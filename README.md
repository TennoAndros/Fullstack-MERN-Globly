# ðŸ“– Fullstack Social Media App

This project is a full-stack social media app created for training and exploration purposes. It showcases the use of RESTful API and the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a full-stack application that combines both the front-end and back-end components. It serves as a learning resource to understand the integration of client and server technologies using RESTful principles and other technologies.

## Contents

This repository consists of two main folders:

### 1. Client

The `client` folder contains the front-end of the application, developed using React, React Redux, MUI. It showcases the user interface and interactions of the social media app.

### 2. Server

The `server` folder contains the back-end of the application, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It handles data storage, processing, and interaction with the client.

**Each folder contains a readme with instructions on how to set-up the project cloning and installing dependencies and more details about the functionality.**
