# Globly

Welcome to Globly, a social networking application that allows users to connect with friends, share moments, and interact with posts. With a focus on user authentication and dynamic content, Globly offers various features to enhance your social experience. This is a web application which was created while continuing exploring React Redux MongodDB and MUI. There is not a lot of functionality yet as my main goal was to understand React Redux and MUI.

I do not own any of the media used and they were used for the sole purpose of practicing and learning.
